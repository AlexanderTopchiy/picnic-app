We are at our best when we’re connected--with our passions, our world, and with each other! Let Picnic be the social media destination for getting YOU out there to communities that share your interests and love them just as much as you. Picnic makes it easy to dive directly into feeds centered around your interests, toggle between those interest feeds, and find exactly what you’re in the mood for. Share fun short videos, pictures, and messages with others in your interest groups! No matter what you love (from writing to scuba diving to fashion), Picnic has a home for you.

Make the most out of your interests! Here’s how Picnic works:

+ Add your profile to/Join circles most interesting to you - Make the most of your time by alternating through feeds of your specific interests. If you love dogs and true crime, scroll through feeds filled with the trendiest cute dog videos, debates over the best types of dog food, and the latest news on serial killers.

+ Tap into your interests - See what others are saying about topics you love. Chat and respond to them!

+ Share content in whatever format you want! We support videos, images, links, and text posts.

+ Get heard by those who share your interests and hobbies - Make connections and share your ideas on the things you love!

+ The more you engage in a circle on Picnic, the more your content will be seen

+ Pick up a new interest - We’ll recommend communities that you might be interested in based on your current engagement
